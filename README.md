# DepthsOfThePowderFields

*This was a short game I made for a game jam in early 2023. It serves as a proof of concept for a new game mechanic: simulating a weapon via cellular automata. I ended up developing the algorithms for this system and building a wave-based survival system around it. It's a little bit janky, you can't expect perfection when I had less than two days to finish this!*

**Story:**

You are stuck in one of the galaxy's many lunar powder fields. Long ago, people used to mine here for exotic resources. However, now it's populated by robots and alien creatures. You aim to get to the bottom of the lunar powder mine by taking the giant elevator and fighting enemies on each floor. Good luck! You're going to need it for whatever you seek down there...

**Gameplay:**
- Wave-based survival
- No health pickups
- Harvest materials from your enemies and the environment to build your weapon
- The materials and patterns you use on your weapon will affect its damage and speed
- Your weapon will require active maintenance, even in the middle of battle!
